--1. Show the name and population in millions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Divide the population by 1000000 to get population in millions.
SELECT name, population/1000000 AS pop FROM world WHERE continent = 'South America';

--2. Show the name and population for France, Germany, Italy

--3. Show the countries which have a name that includes the word 'United'
SELECT name FROM world WHERE name LIKE '%United%';

--4. Show the countries that are big by area or big by population. Show name, population and area. A country is big if it has an area of more than 3 million sq km or it has a population of more than 250 million.
SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE area >= 3000000 OR population >= 250000000;

--5. Show the countries that are big by area (more than 3 million) or big by population (more than 250 million) but not both. Show name, population and area.
SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE (population>250000000 OR area>3000000) AND NOT(population>250000000 AND area>3000000);
SELECT name, population, area FROM world WHERE area > 3000000 XOR population > 250000000;

--6. Show the name and population in millions and the GDP in billions for the countries of the continent 'South America'. Use the ROUND function to show the values to two decimal places.
SELECT name, ROUND(population/1000000, 2), ROUND(gdp/1000000000, 2) FROM world WHERE continent = 'South America';

--7. Show the name and per-capita GDP for those countries with a GDP of at least one trillion (1000000000000; that is 12 zeros). Round this value to the nearest 1000.
SELECT name, ROUND(gdp/population, -3) AS percapitaGDP FROM world WHERE GDP >= 1000000000000;

--8. Show the name and capital where the name and the capital have the same number of characters.
SELECT name, capital FROM world WHERE len(name) = len(capital);

--9. Show the name and the capital where the first letters of each match. Don't include countries where the name and the capital are the same word.
